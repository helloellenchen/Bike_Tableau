# Tableau Assignment - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.


Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? We've heard all of these questions and more from you, and we're happy to provide the data to help you discover the answers to these questions and more. We invite developers, engineers, statisticians, artists, academics and other interested members of the public to use the data we provide for analysis, development, visualization and whatever else moves you.

## Data and Variables for analysis

Eeach month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.
We publish downloadable files of Citi Bike trip data. The data includes:

Trip Duration (seconds)
Start Time and Date
Stop Time and Date
Start Station Name
End Station Name
Station ID
Station Lat/Long
Bike ID
User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)
Year of Birth

In this analysis, we combine each of the CSVs for eache month to become one single file as citi_ride.csv for total year of 2017 and make singe sheet for each question answered as follows:

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
